Insert command will creat 2 job.
Insert into table demo_1 select * from demo_2;
job1: read demo_2, process data, write it to a temp locations.
job2: move temp data data to demo_2 table (hdfs locations)

job1: data processing
job2: commit / move data

this will happens for both managed, & ext table, with this it can prevent
partial insert / corrupted data if the job will fails. 

thus it ensure atomicity, means data is either fully return to hdfs path or not written at all.
